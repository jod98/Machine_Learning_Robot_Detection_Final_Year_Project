# Machine_Learning_Robot_Detection_Final_Year_Project
RoboEireann is a NUI (National University of Ireland) Maynooth funded research project that features a soccer team composed of programmable autonomous Nao robots. The team annually competes in the RoboCup competition against international competitors. This project investigates RoboEireann’s current robot detection program which is a program that aids these devices to detect other robots in their environment. Current issues relate to its inability to produce high accuracy results. The aim is to improve the current program by utilising machine learning principles. An enhanced version of the RoboEireann’s SPL (Standard Platform League) dataset was created and provided as input to an object detection neural network which compared many pre-trained models. Experimentation of various machine learning frameworks, architectures and object detection algorithms was conducted to determine the optimal solution. This solution will be integrated into each robot in real-time during a competitive match. These findings have significant implications for the development of robotics and artificial intelligence.
